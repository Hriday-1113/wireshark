# Wireshark: A Brief Introduction and Code Implementation

## **Introduction**
Wireshark is a leading open-source network protocol analyzer that allows users to capture, inspect, and analyze network traffic in real-time. It supports various network protocols and provides tools to troubleshoot issues, detect security threats, and learn about network communication. With its powerful features and cross-platform compatibility, Wireshark is widely used by network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and IT learners.

## **Code Implementation Overview**
This project includes a Python implementation that leverages Wireshark capture files to analyze RTP (Real-Time Protocol) traffic. The script extracts audio streams from a `.pcap` file and saves them as `.wav` files for further analysis or playback.

### **Key Features of the Code**
1. **Reads `.pcap` Files**: Parses network traffic files captured using Wireshark.
2. **Filters RTP Packets**: Focuses on RTP packets within the capture.
3. **Extracts Payload**: Decodes the audio payload from RTP streams.
4. **Saves as Audio File**: Outputs the extracted audio as a `.wav` file.

## **Getting Started with the Code**

### **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Required Python libraries:
   - `pyshark`
   - `scipy`
   - `numpy`
   - `wave`

Install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pyshark scipy numpy


### **How to Use the Script**
1. Place the `.pcap` file (e.g., `capture.pcap`) in the same directory as the script.
2. Update the filename in the script to match your `.pcap` file:
   ```python
   pcap_file = "capture.pcap"
   output_audio_file = "output.wav"
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python rtp_extraction.py
   ```
4. The extracted audio file (`output.wav`) will be saved in the same directory.

## **Code Walkthrough**

### **1. Parsing the `.pcap` File**
The script uses `pyshark` to load and filter RTP packets:
```python
cap = pyshark.FileCapture(pcap_file, display_filter="rtp")
```

### **2. Extracting RTP Payload**
RTP payloads are decoded and assembled into audio data using `numpy`:
```python
payload = bytes.fromhex(packet.rtp.payload.raw_value)
audio_data = np.frombuffer(payload, dtype=np.uint8)
```

### **3. Writing to WAV File**
The audio data is written into a `.wav` file using the `wave` module:
```python
with wave.open(output_audio_file, "wb") as wav_file:
    wav_file.setnchannels(1)
    wav_file.setsampwidth(1)
    wav_file.setframerate(8000)
    wav_file.writeframes(audio_bytes)
```

---

## **Important Notes**
- Ensure that the `.pcap` file contains valid RTP traffic.
- The script assumes an 8kHz, single-channel audio format.
- For other formats or advanced decoding, modifications may be required.

---

## **Conclusion**
This implementation demonstrates how to analyze and process network traffic captured via Wireshark using Python. By extracting audio data from RTP packets, the script highlights the importance of understanding network protocols and their applications. This project is a practical example of combining network analysis with programming to solve real-world problems.
